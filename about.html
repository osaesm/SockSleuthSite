          <h3>Christina Caragein</h3>
          <p>
            Christina Caragein, a proud mother of three (who have successfully navigated their way to
            adulthood, phew!), has spent her life mastering the art of the multi-tasking superhero. For
            decades, she&#39;s been the heart of the classroom, turning &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; into &quot;I did&quot;
            for countless elementary students and making every lesson feel like an adventure. She lives by the
            philosophy that a little gratitude and a lot of joy can make ordinary moments extraordinary.
            <br /><br />Now, with her retirement compass pointing toward the horizon, Christina is trading her red
            grading pens for a permanent place at the writer&#39;s desk. She&#39;s not just closing this book, she&#39;s
            starting a brand-new chapter as a full-time author. Get ready for more heart, more humor, and
            more of the captivating storytelling she&#39;s spent a lifetime perfecting.

          <h3>Francis Cleetus</h3>
          <p>
            Francis Cleetus started drawing on walls at an early age. His Indian parents weren&#39;t thrilled,
            hoping to see him in scrubs instead of overalls. He wasn&#39;t left-brained enough to be a doctor, so
            he reluctantly got a degree in chemistry and started working at a tire factory. Just a year later,
            he quit and returned to school to study design and copywriting.
            <br /><br />He went on to work at ad agencies in India, Hong Kong, and the US, and win a mantle full of
            creative awards. His parents weren&#39;t ecstatic this time around, either. Francis has created TV
            spots for the PA Lottery, cartoons for the Pittsburgh Tech Council&#39;s magazine, murals for the
            Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens, and paintings for the Pittsburgh Arts Council. But he
            still hasn&#39;t figured out why his wife and two daughters prefer mauve over lilac.
